# My first project at RGU

This is the code for my first project we completed during my 1st Year at RGU.

The brief for this project was to create a short animation using p5.js that promoted sustainablilty.

The code content for this project was almost all Javascript and required using basic constructs in procedural development that I was familiar with however using Javascript rather than Python added some more interest to the project
